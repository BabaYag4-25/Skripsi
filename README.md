Creating Parkinson's disease detection through voice using jitter and shimmer features
- Using datasets from the IEEE DataPort.
- Datasets processed using CNN machine learning.
- Jitter and shimmer features are used to analyse variations in sound frequency and amplitude stability.
- Implemented with python language into Raspberry pi 4 model B equipped with LCD and mic.
- The resulting performance is very good by producing a model accuracy of 89%, with a prediction accuracy percentage for the non-parkinsonian class of 75% and the parkinton class of 85%.
